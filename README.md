INTRODUCTION

WalletHub ranks Nashville as the fourth best real estate market in the United States after analyzing 300 cities across 24 key variables ("Nashville Real Estate," 2020). The rating is based on major investment characteristics such as real estate market activity, property value growth, and the local economy's strength. The patterns and development of property prices from 2013 to 2016 will be discussed in this paper, which are elements that place Nashville among the top four housing markets in the country. The study will show how many properties have been exchanged, changes in the housing sales price, and Nashville housing trends over time. The Nashville housing data set has whole information regarding properties in Nashville and its neighboring cities.


DATA CLEANING

There is some unneeded data in the data set that can be used to study solely the patterns and growth of certain properties' sales. Suite #, Legal Preference, Multiple Parcel Involved in Sales, Sold as Vacant, Tax District, Finished Area, Acreage, Foundation Type, Exterior Wall, Grade, Bedrooms, Full Bath, and Half Bath variables have been eliminated. Some of the variables that have been eliminated have an influence on property sales prices.
Unfortunately, there were more missing values for those variables than there were existent values, and I couldn't assume those values, so I opted to eliminate them. Some missing numbers in the data set are required for assessing trends and changes in property sales. There are some missing values in Land Value, Building Value, and Total Value, and those variables are important
 


in determining what I'm attempting to find out from this dataset. I put in those missing numbers because they may greatly lower the size of the data collection.
